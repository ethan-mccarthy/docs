> Instructions for [preparing the Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-thermal-printer) and [configuring CUPS](https://learn.adafruit.com/networked-thermal-printer-using-cups-and-raspberry-pi) are based on the guides produced by Phillip Burgess at Adafruit

To get everything you need (including a nice enclosure), you can order the the [Adafruit IoT Pi Printer Pack v2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1289). **Be aware the kit does not include a Raspberry Pi computer â€” I suggest ordering the low-cost Raspberry Pi Zero W!**
