***Avis means newspaper in Danish***

avis is a Python program that compiles weather, calendar, news, and social media data and prints a summary using a thermal printer connected to a Raspberry Pi. avis aims to reduce smartphone usage by providing the user relevant information at one point of the day, rather than repeatedly checking smartphone apps.  

Since some news and social media outlets produce a high volume of updates daily (e.g., the user's Twitter home feed), avis may be configured to take a random sample of updates from each source. Although this approach omits some updates, it provides an unbiased method for update selection.
